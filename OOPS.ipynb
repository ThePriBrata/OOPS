    "01.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? \n",
    "    -> OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects and classes, enabling modularity, reusability, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "02.What is a class in OOP? \n",
    "    -> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "03.What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "    -> An object is an instance of a class, containing data (attributes) and methods to perform specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "04.Difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ->Abstraction: Hiding the complexity and showing only the essential details (e.g., using an interface or abstract class).\n",
    "    \n",
    "      Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "05.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "    ->Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, and __repr__ are special methods with predefined meanings to customize object behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "06.Concept of inheritance in OOP:\n",
    "    -> Inheritance enables a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "07.What is polymorphism in OOP? \n",
    "    -> Polymorphism allows objects to take multiple forms, enabling a single method or operator to perform differently based on the context (e.g., method overriding).\n",
    "\n",
    "08.How is encapsulation achieved in Python? \n",
    "    -> Encapsulation is achieved using private (_variable or __variable) and public members in classes to control access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "09.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "    -> A constructor, defined as __init__, is a special method automatically called when an object is created, initializing its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Class and static methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Class methods: Use @classmethod and operate on the class, not instances. They take cls as the first argument.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Static methods: Use @staticmethod and are independent of the class/instance. They are like regular functions within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What is method overloading in Python? \n",
    "    -> Python doesn't directly support method overloading, but different behaviors can be achieved by using optional/default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.What is method overriding in OOP? \n",
    "    -> When a child class redefines a method of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What is a property decorator in Python? \n",
    "    -> The @property decorator is used to define getter methods that access a private attribute as if it were public.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP? \n",
    "    -> Polymorphism enhances code flexibility and reusability by enabling methods to be used with different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "15.What is an abstract class in Python? \n",
    "    -> An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (defined using @abstractmethod) and cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "16.Advantages of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Modularity\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Code reusability\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Abstraction\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Scalability\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "17.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "    -> Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.Difference between class variable and instance variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Class variable: Shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       Instance variable: Unique to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "19.Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -> __str__: Returns a human-readable representation of an object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     __repr__: Returns an unambiguous representation, often for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "20.Significance of the super() function in Python:\n",
    "    -> It allows a child class to access methods and attributes of its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "21.Significance of the __del__ method in Python: \n",
    "    -> It is a destructor method invoked when an object is garbage-collected, used to release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "22.Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> @staticmethod: Does not access or modify class state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       @classmethod: Operates on class-level data using cls.\n",
    "\n",
    "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "    -> Polymorphism allows child classes to redefine parent methods, letting objects of different classes respond to the same method call differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP? \n",
    "    -> Method chaining involves calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "25.Purpose of the __call__ method in Python: \n",
    "    -> It makes an object callable like a function, enabling customization of function-like behavior."
